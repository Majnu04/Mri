    Potential enhancements using pre-trained models:
    
    1. MedSAM Integration:
       - Segment Anything Model for Medical Images
       - No training required, just download weights
    
    2. SimpleITK Integration:
       - Advanced medical image processing
       - Built-in tumor detection algorithms
    
    3. MONAI Framework:
       - Medical Open Network for AI
       - Pre-trained models for brain MRI
    
    Implementation would be:
    - Download pre-trained weights
    - Add to requirements.txt
    - Integrate as optional enhancement
